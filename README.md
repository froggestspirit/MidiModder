# MidiModder
Version 0.3
By FroggestSpirit

Batch Midi Parser for Python 3

Convert Midi files to text for viewing/editing, then back to Midi

For best results, use Midi version 1 files

Usage: MidiModder.py mode input output

mode: -e  Encode text file to Midi  | -d  Decode Midi to text file  | -a  Analyze the Midi and display information  | -h  Show help

You can also drag and drop a .mid file to convert to txt with the same filename, or drag a .txt to convert to midi.
Keep in mind the program will not ask if you want to overwrite files, so make backups!
